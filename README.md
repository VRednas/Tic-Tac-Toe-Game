 ## Objective

 This game was created with the aim of applying my knowledge acquired in pure Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 in my studies. It is still under development, where new functions will be added from time to time. Hope you like the game, which is simple but functional. And remember: tic-tac-toe was the first game Bill Gates created, everyone starts from the beginning. :blink:

## How it works

The game works as a normal tic-tac-toe. There are two players, one uses "X" and the other one uses "O" to mark down the squares in the screen. The objective is to mark a sequence of three "X" or "O", depending of the player. The one who make the sequence first is the winner. Simple. If no one makes a sequence, its GAME OVER too.

## Commands

First of all, open the game webapp in your browser. As it runs in pure Javascript, the web browser console is the place you put your commands. To open your command console:

 - If you are running it in Google Chrome, use "Option + ⌘ + J" (on macOS), or "Shift + CTRL + J" (on Windows/Linux);
 - For Safari browser, press "Option + ⌘ + C";
 - For Mozilla Firefox, press "Shift + ⌘ + J" (on macOS) or "Shift + CTRL + J" (on Windows/Linux);
 - In Microsoft Edge, press "CTRL + Shift + i" to open it;
 - If you are running it in another browser, I´m sorry, the game doesn´t support hipsters.

Use your mouse to mark downs the square you want. Remember to respect the player sequence. Once there is a winner, the console will show a message with the winner sequence and a "GAME OVER". If there is no winner, it will just show "GAME OVER".

If you want to restart the game, write the command "tic-tac-toe.restart()" on the console (with no commas) end press "enter".

## Especial Thanks and Considerations

This game was developed with love and sweat, but wasn´t done alone, off course. I leave my thanks here:

 - To my family, for the pacience and emotional support;
 - Google, for references;
 - Coffee, for mental health;
 - Código Fonte TV (Youtube channel), for the content to this project;
 - You, for the time spent on my game. 

As I said, this project is based in (forked) the tic-tac-toe game created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/codigofontetv">Código Fonte TV</a>, an Youtube channel, in their videos. And as they did, I will keep it public, becouse that is how it has to be done.

Remember, as a game made by a single person, it may have some bugs. Be free to open an issue and help me!
